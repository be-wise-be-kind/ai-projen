dependencies:
  required:
    - foundation/ai-folder
  optional: []

features:
  provides:
    - .roadmaps/ directory structure with lifecycle phases
    - Three-document roadmap structure (PROGRESS_TRACKER, PR_BREAKDOWN, AI_CONTEXT)
    - Roadmap templates in .ai/templates/
    - Workflow documentation in .ai/docs/
    - AGENTS.md integration for roadmap detection
    - how-to-roadmap.md guide

  directory_structure:
    - .roadmaps/planning/ (roadmaps being planned)
    - .roadmaps/in-progress/ (active roadmaps)
    - .roadmaps/complete/ (archived roadmaps)
    - .roadmaps/how-to-roadmap.md (workflow guide)

  templates:
    - roadmap-progress-tracker.md.template (primary handoff document)
    - roadmap-pr-breakdown.md.template (PR implementation guide)
    - roadmap-ai-context.md.template (feature architecture context)

  documentation:
    - ROADMAP_WORKFLOW.md (workflow documentation in .ai/docs/)
    - how-to-roadmap.md (user guide in .roadmaps/)

installation:
  guide: AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
  type: foundational

  steps_summary:
    - Create .roadmaps/ directory with lifecycle subdirectories
    - Copy roadmap templates to .ai/templates/
    - Create how-to-roadmap.md guide
    - Add ROADMAP_WORKFLOW.md documentation
    - Update AGENTS.md with roadmap routing
    - Update .ai/index.yaml with roadmap resources
    - Validate installation

use_cases:
  - Multi-PR features requiring coordinated implementation
  - Large repository upgrades with phased rollout
  - Complex features with multiple dependencies
  - Team coordination across AI agent sessions
  - Progress tracking for long-running development

integration:
  agents_md:
    section: "Roadmap-Driven Development"
    detection_patterns:
      planning:
        - "I want to plan out..."
        - "Create a roadmap for..."
        - "Plan the implementation of..."
      continuation:
        - "Continue with..."
        - "What's next in..."
        - "Resume work on..."

  index_yaml:
    section: roadmaps
    resources:
      - location: .roadmaps/
      - guide: .roadmaps/how-to-roadmap.md
      - workflow_docs: .ai/docs/ROADMAP_WORKFLOW.md
      - templates: .ai/templates/roadmap-*.md.template

philosophy:
  - "Complex features require structured planning"
  - "Roadmaps enable AI agent coordination across sessions"
  - "Three-document structure provides complete context"
  - "Lifecycle management (planning → in-progress → complete)"
  - "Progress tracking is essential for multi-PR features"

validation:
  success_criteria:
    - .roadmaps/ directory exists with three subdirectories
    - how-to-roadmap.md exists in .roadmaps/
    - Three roadmap templates in .ai/templates/
    - ROADMAP_WORKFLOW.md exists in .ai/docs/
    - AGENTS.md updated with roadmap section
    - .ai/index.yaml includes roadmap resources

notes_for_agents:
  - This plugin is foundational for complex feature development
  - Always read PROGRESS_TRACKER.md first when continuing roadmap work
  - Update PROGRESS_TRACKER.md immediately after completing each PR
  - Use AI_CONTEXT.md for features with complex architecture
  - Archive completed roadmaps for future reference
