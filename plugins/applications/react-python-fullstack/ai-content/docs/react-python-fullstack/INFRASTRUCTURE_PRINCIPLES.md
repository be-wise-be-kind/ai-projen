## Core Principles

### 1. Security First

**Principle**: Security is embedded at every layer, not added as an afterthought.

**Implementation**:
- Encryption at rest (S3, RDS, EBS)
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS, TLS)
- Network segmentation (public/private subnets)
- Least privilege IAM policies
- GitHub OIDC (no static credentials)
- Security group rules tightly scoped
- ECR image scanning enabled

**Validation**:
- No hardcoded credentials in code
- All data encrypted
- Security groups follow least privilege
- IAM roles with minimal permissions

### 2. High Availability

**Principle**: Infrastructure withstands failures with minimal impact.

**Implementation**:
- Multi-AZ deployment (2+ availability zones)
- Auto-scaling for ECS services
- ALB for traffic distribution
- RDS Multi-AZ for production
- NAT Gateway per AZ
- Health checks for all services

**Validation**:
- Services run in multiple AZs
- Auto-scaling policies configured
- Health checks passing
- Failover tested

### 3. Infrastructure as Code

**Principle**: All infrastructure is version-controlled and reproducible.

**Implementation**:
- Terraform for all resources
- Git for version control
- Workspace per environment
- Modules for reusability
- State stored in S3
- Changes through pull requests

**Validation**:
- No manual resource creation
- All changes in git history
- Terraform state matches reality
- Reproducible deployments

### 4. Environment Isolation

**Principle**: Environments are completely isolated with no cross-contamination.

**Implementation**:
- Separate Terraform workspaces
- Isolated state files in S3
- Separate VPCs per environment
- Environment-specific configurations
- Separate AWS accounts (recommended)

**Validation**:
- State files isolated
- No shared resources between envs
- Configuration validated per env
- Clear environment boundaries

### 5. Cost Optimization

**Principle**: Optimize costs without compromising security or reliability.

**Implementation**:
- Right-sized instances per environment
- Auto-scaling to match demand
- ECR lifecycle policies (10 images)
- Single NAT Gateway in dev/staging
- Spot instances for non-critical workloads (future)
- Reserved instances for prod (future)

**Validation**:
- Cost per environment tracked
- No over-provisioned resources
- Auto-scaling active
- Resource utilization monitored

### 6. Operational Excellence

**Principle**: Operations are automated, monitored, and continuously improved.

**Implementation**:
- CloudWatch Container Insights
- Centralized logging
- Auto-scaling based on metrics
- Deployment automation (CI/CD)
- Terraform via Docker (no local deps)
- Comprehensive documentation

**Validation**:
- Logs centralized in CloudWatch
- Metrics visible and actionable
- Deployments automated
- Runbooks documented

### 7. Fail-Safe Defaults

**Principle**: Default configurations favor security and reliability over convenience.

**Implementation**:
- Deletion protection enabled for prod
- Encryption enabled by default
- Versioning enabled for state
- Automated backups for RDS
- Multi-AZ for production databases
- Private subnets for workloads

**Validation**:
- Critical resources protected
- Backups configured and tested
- Encryption verified
- Default deny security groups

## Design Patterns

### Pattern 1: Workspace-Based Multi-Environment

**Use Case**: Manage multiple environments with shared code

**Structure**:
```
workspaces/base/
  - Shared code for all environments
  - Workspace-specific state in S3
  - Environment-aware conditionals
```

**Benefits**:
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Consistent configuration
- Easy environment creation
- Isolated state

### Pattern 2: Reusable Modules

**Use Case**: Common infrastructure patterns

**Structure**:
```
modules/ecs-service/
  - Inputs via variables
  - Outputs for consumption
  - Self-contained resources
```

**Benefits**:
- Code reuse
- Tested patterns
- Consistent implementations
- Faster development

### Pattern 3: Remote State with Locking

**Use Case**: Team collaboration, state protection

**Structure**:
```
Bootstrap creates:
  - S3 bucket (state storage)
  - DynamoDB table (locking)
  - Versioning enabled
```

**Benefits**:
- Concurrent access prevention
- State history
- Team collaboration
- Disaster recovery

### Pattern 4: GitOps with OIDC

**Use Case**: Secure CI/CD without static credentials

**Structure**:
```
GitHub Actions →
  OIDC token →
  Assume AWS role →
  Deploy infrastructure
```

**Benefits**:
- No static credentials
- Short-lived tokens
- Audit trail
- Least privilege

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth

Multiple security layers:
1. Network (VPC, subnets, NACLs)
2. Instance (security groups)
3. Application (IAM, encryption)
4. Data (encryption at rest/transit)

### Principle of Least Privilege

- IAM roles have minimal permissions
- Security groups allow only required traffic
- No public database access
- ECS tasks in private subnets

### Secrets Management

- AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data
- No secrets in Terraform code
- Environment variables from secrets
- Rotation policies enabled

## Reliability Principles

### Fault Tolerance

- Multi-AZ deployment
- Auto-recovery for failed tasks
- Health checks and automatic replacement
- Graceful degradation

### Disaster Recovery

- RDS automated backups (7 days)
- S3 state versioning
- Infrastructure recreatable from code
- Tested rollback procedures

### Observability

- CloudWatch logs for all services
- Container Insights for ECS
- Custom metrics for business logic
- Distributed tracing (future)

## Performance Principles

### Scalability

- Horizontal scaling via auto-scaling
- Vertical scaling via instance types
- Database read replicas (future)
- Caching layer (future)

### Latency Optimization

- Multi-AZ for low latency
- ALB for intelligent routing
- Database connection pooling
- CDN for static assets (future)

## Cost Principles

### Right-Sizing

- Dev: Minimal resources (t3.micro)
- Staging: Mirrors prod at lower scale
- Prod: Sized for peak + buffer

### Resource Optimization

- Auto-scaling to match demand
- Spot instances for batch workloads
- Reserved instances for baseline
- Lifecycle policies for old data

## Operational Principles

### Automation First

- All operations via Make targets
- CI/CD for deployments
- Terraform for all changes
- No manual AWS console changes

### Documentation

- Architecture diagrams
- Runbooks for common tasks
- How-to guides for operations
- Decision logs

### Continuous Improvement

- Regular cost reviews
- Security audits
- Performance optimization
- Architecture evolution

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Residency

- All data in specified region
- No cross-region replication (unless required)
- Compliance with local regulations

### Audit Logging

- CloudTrail for API calls
- ALB access logs
- Application logs
- Security group changes tracked

### Access Control

- MFA for sensitive operations
- Role-based access control
- Temporary credentials only
- Regular access reviews

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-region deployment
- Blue/green deployment pattern
- Canary deployments
- Service mesh integration
- Advanced monitoring (Datadog/New Relic)
- Cost anomaly detection
- Automated compliance scanning
