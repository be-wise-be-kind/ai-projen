# Purpose: Terraform backend configuration for development environment
# Scope: S3 remote state backend settings for dev workspace
# Overview: Configures Terraform to use S3 for remote state storage with DynamoDB for state locking
#     in the development environment. Ensures state isolation between environments and enables
#     team collaboration on infrastructure changes.
# Dependencies: Bootstrap workspace must be applied first to create S3 bucket and DynamoDB table
# Usage: terraform init -backend-config=backend-config/dev.tfbackend
