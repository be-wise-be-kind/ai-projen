# Application metadata
metadata:
  use_case: Command-line tools and utilities with professional-grade packaging and distribution
  target_users: Developers building CLI tools, DevOps automation scripts, system utilities
  complexity: intermediate
  estimated_setup_time: 10-15 minutes

  python_version:
    default: "3.11"
    supported: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
    ask_user: true
    prompt: "Which Python version? (3.10, 3.11, 3.12)"

  technology_stack:
    primary_language: python
    dependency_manager: Poetry (isolated venv - doesn't corrupt user machine)
    frameworks:
      - Click 8.x
      - pytest
      - Ruff
    infrastructure:

  application_type: cli

  philosophy:
    - "Use Poetry for isolated virtual environments"
    - "Never corrupt the user's machine with global installs"
    - "Always use Make targets, not direct python/pytest/ruff commands"
    - "All operations through isolated Poetry venv"

# Known limitations
limitations:
  - Designed for single-file CLI distribution (not multi-binary projects)
  - Config file location is fixed to user home or current directory
  - Docker image includes full Python runtime (not optimized for size)

# Future enhancements
future:
  - Add plugin system for extensibility
  - Support for auto-completion in bash/zsh
  - Add interactive mode with prompt_toolkit
  - Package as standalone binary with PyInstaller
