# Security How-To Guides

**Purpose**: Index of step-by-step security implementation guides for preventing secrets, scanning dependencies, and configuring code analysis

**Scope**: All security-related procedural guides within the security standards plugin

**Overview**: Provides organized access to comprehensive how-to guides covering the three pillars of application security: secrets management, dependency scanning, and code scanning. Each guide offers practical, step-by-step instructions for implementing security controls, from basic setup through advanced configurations. Guides include prerequisites, estimated completion times, difficulty levels, and hands-on examples for immediate implementation.

**Dependencies**: Security scanning tools, GitHub Advanced Security, pre-commit hooks, CI/CD systems

**Exports**: Navigation to security how-to guides, difficulty assessments, time estimates, prerequisites

**Related**: secrets-management.md, dependency-scanning.md, code-scanning.md, SECURITY_STANDARDS.md

**Implementation**: Structured guide index with clear difficulty levels and time expectations for planning security implementations
