# Purpose: Pytest configuration for Python testing
# Scope: Test discovery, execution, and reporting
# Overview: Pytest is a mature full-featured Python testing tool. Configured for
#     test discovery, async support, markers, and coverage reporting.
# Dependencies: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov (install via pip/poetry)
# Exports: Testing configuration
# Related: Python testing, test automation
# Implementation: INI-style configuration for pytest

[pytest]
# Test discovery paths
testpaths = tests

# Test file patterns
python_files = test_*.py *_test.py

# Test function patterns
python_functions = test_*

# Test class patterns
python_classes = Test*

# Async support
asyncio_mode = auto

# Additional options
addopts =
    --tb=short
    --strict-markers
    --strict-config
    -v

# Cache directory
cache_dir = /tmp/.pytest_cache

# Custom markers
markers =
    unit: marks tests as unit tests (fast, isolated)
    integration: marks tests as integration tests (may require external services)
    slow: marks tests as slow running tests
    smoke: marks tests as smoke tests (quick validation)
    e2e: marks tests as end-to-end tests

# Minimum Python version
minversion = 7.0

# Test output verbosity
console_output_style = progress

# Disable warnings summary (optional - remove if you want warnings)
# filterwarnings =
#     ignore::DeprecationWarning
