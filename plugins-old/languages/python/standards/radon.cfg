# Purpose: Radon configuration for cyclomatic complexity and maintainability analysis
# Scope: Code complexity measurement, maintainability index calculation
# Overview: Radon configuration for enforcing Grade A complexity (CC 1-5) and maintainability
#     (MI 20-100) standards. Used for complexity analysis and enforcement in CI/CD pipelines.
# Dependencies: radon
# Exports: Complexity and maintainability standards configuration
# Related: Code complexity standards, maintainability metrics
# Implementation: INI-style radon configuration file
