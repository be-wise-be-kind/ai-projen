## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context

1. **Rust is Different from Python**:
   - Type checking is built into the compiler (rustc), not a separate tool
   - One standard formatter (rustfmt), not multiple options
   - One primary linter (Clippy), community has converged
   - Cargo is the universal build tool (no Poetry vs pip fragmentation)

2. **MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version)**:
   - Always declare MSRV in Cargo.toml (`rust-version = "1.70.0"`)
   - Increasing MSRV is a breaking change (SemVer major bump)
   - Clippy should respect MSRV in lint rules

3. **Cargo.lock Handling**:
   - **Binaries**: Commit Cargo.lock (ensures reproducible builds)
   - **Libraries**: Gitignore Cargo.lock (allow flexible dependency resolution)
   - Document this distinction clearly

4. **Tool Installation**:
   - Prefer rustup components: `rustup component add clippy rustfmt`
   - Use cargo install for third-party tools: `cargo install cargo-nextest`
   - Consider binary releases for faster CI (instead of compiling with cargo install)

5. **Make Target Naming**:
   - All Rust targets namespaced: `rust-*`
   - Prevents conflicts with Python (`python-*`) and TypeScript (`ts-*`)
   - Example: `make rust-check`, `make rust-lint`, `make rust-test`

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't create a type checker plugin** - type checking is mandatory in Rust (rustc)
2. **Don't offer multiple formatters** - rustfmt is the only standard
3. **Don't skip MSRV declaration** - critical for library compatibility
4. **Don't ignore cargo-deny** - license compliance and policy enforcement are important
5. **Don't use `cargo test` alone** - cargo-nextest is 3x faster and more reliable
6. **Don't forget caching in CI** - Rust CI without caching is very slow
7. **Don't mix binary and library templates** - ask user for project type

### Resources

1. **Reference Implementations**:
   - Python plugin: `plugins/languages/python/` (similar structure)
   - TypeScript plugin: `plugins/languages/typescript/` (similar structure)
   - Language template: `plugins/languages/_template/` (structure guide)

2. **Documentation**:
   - PLUGIN_ARCHITECTURE.md: How plugins work
   - PLUGIN_GIT_WORKFLOW_STANDARD.md: Branching requirements
   - FILE_HEADER_STANDARDS.md: File documentation requirements
   - HOWTO_STANDARDS.md: How-to guide standards

3. **Rust Ecosystem Resources**:
   - Cargo Book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/
   - Clippy Lints: https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/
   - Rust API Guidelines: https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/
   - RustSec Advisory DB: https://rustsec.org/

4. **AI Research Completed**:
   - Comprehensive Rust best practices documented in AI_CONTEXT.md
   - Tool research (Cargo, Clippy, rustfmt, security, testing) complete
   - Industry standards for 2025 incorporated
