# Purpose: AI navigation index for ai-projen repository
# Scope: Repository structure, available resources, commands, and documentation
# Overview: Provides AI agents with a quick reference to navigate the ai-projen repository structure,
#     locate key files, understand available commands, and access documentation. Essential for AI agents
#     to quickly orient themselves when working on the framework or understanding how to use it.

  orchestration:
    - Manifest-driven discovery
    - Interactive question flow
    - Custom roadmap generation
    - Sequential PR execution
    - Resume capability

  extraction:
    - .ai folder structure
    - Makefile patterns
    - Docker setup
    - GitHub Actions workflows
    - Terraform workspace patterns
    - Pre-commit hooks
    - Standards documentation

  priorities:
    - P0: Core framework (PR1-4)
    - P1: Language & infrastructure plugins (PR5-12)
    - P2: Standards plugins (PR13-16)
    - P3: Orchestrators (PR17-19)
    - P4: Launch (PR20-21)

contributing:
  guidelines: CONTRIBUTING.md (coming in PR21)
  plugin_creation: .ai/howto/how-to-create-a-plugin.md (coming soon)
  testing: Use test-empty-setup/, test-incremental-setup/, test-upgrade-existing/

notes_for_agents:
  - This is a self-referential repository (it uses the patterns it teaches)
  - All plugins should work standalone (without orchestrator)
  - State is tracked via roadmap/ai_projen_implementation/PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
  - Patterns extracted from durable-code-test (production-proven)
  - Framework grows through community contributions
