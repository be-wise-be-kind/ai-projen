## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context

**Philosophy**: The python-cli plugin should be a TRUE meta-plugin orchestrator. It should leverage ALL capabilities of the python core plugin, not just a subset. When a user asks for a "polished Python CLI", they expect EVERY quality gate and distribution method, not manual setup.

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Comprehensive > Basic**: Install ALL tools (Pylint, Flake8, Radon, Xenon, Safety, pip-audit), not just Ruff/MyPy
2. **Makefile Orchestration**: Use python core's Makefile.python for consistent command interface
3. **Automated Distribution**: Git tag should publish to PyPI, Docker Hub, and GitHub automatically
4. **Validation First**: Provide validation script so users know everything works
5. **Documentation Complete**: Document EVERY capability so nothing is hidden

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't Skip Comprehensive Tooling**
   - python-cli currently only installs basic tools
   - Must install ALL comprehensive tools from python core plugin
   - Check `plugins/languages/python/core/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` Step 11

2. **Don't Forget Makefile**
   - Makefile.python exists but isn't installed by python-cli
   - Must copy or include Makefile.python
   - Users need `make help-python` to work

3. **Don't Hard-Code Tool Versions**
   - Use same versions as python core plugin
   - Keep pyproject.toml.template in sync with core plugin

4. **Don't Skip Release Automation**
   - GitHub Actions release workflow is critical
   - Must publish to PyPI, Docker Hub, and GitHub
   - Multi-arch Docker builds (amd64, arm64)

5. **Don't Assume User Knowledge**
   - Document everything
   - Provide how-to guides for all distribution methods
   - Validation script should check everything
