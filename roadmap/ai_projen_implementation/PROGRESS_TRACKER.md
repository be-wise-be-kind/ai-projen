### ✅ COMPLETED: PR7.7 - How-To Template System & Plugin Integration

**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Quick Summary**:
Formalize the how-to framework as a core plugin component. How-tos are AI-agent-focused guides that work hand-in-hand with templates to provide step-by-step instructions for common development tasks. Missing from current framework but fundamental to `.ai` folder structure.

**Problem Identified**:
- How-tos are used in durable-code-test but not formalized in the plugin system
- Each plugin should provide how-tos for common tasks in its domain
- How-tos reference templates and guide agents through implementation
- Currently no structure, validation, or template for creating how-tos in plugins

**Plugin-Specific How-Tos Needed**:

**Python Plugin** (`plugins/languages/python/howtos/`):
- `how-to-create-an-api-endpoint.md` - FastAPI endpoint creation
- `how-to-create-a-cli-command.md` - Click/Typer CLI commands
- `how-to-add-database-model.md` - SQLAlchemy/Pydantic models
- `how-to-write-a-test.md` - pytest test creation
- `how-to-add-background-job.md` - Celery/RQ task creation
- `how-to-handle-authentication.md` - OAuth/JWT implementation

**TypeScript Plugin** (`plugins/languages/typescript/howtos/`):
- `how-to-create-a-component.md` - React component creation
- `how-to-create-a-component-library.md` - Shared component library
- `how-to-add-a-route.md` - React Router route creation
- `how-to-create-a-hook.md` - Custom React hook
- `how-to-add-state-management.md` - Context/Redux integration
- `how-to-write-a-test.md` - Vitest test creation

**Infrastructure Plugin** (`plugins/infrastructure/docker/howtos/`):
- `how-to-add-a-service.md` - Add container to docker-compose
- `how-to-create-multi-stage-dockerfile.md` - Optimize Docker builds
- `how-to-add-volume.md` - Persistent data volumes

**Files to Create**:

1. **Framework Components**:
   - `.ai/docs/HOW_TO_TEMPLATE.md` - Template for creating how-tos
   - `.ai/docs/HOWTO_STANDARDS.md` - Standards for how-to documentation
   - `plugins/_template/howtos/HOWTO_TEMPLATE.md` - Plugin how-to template

2. **Plugin Structure Updates**:
   ```
   plugins/<category>/<name>/
   ├── AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
   ├── README.md
   ├── howtos/              # NEW
   │   ├── README.md        # Index of available how-tos
   │   └── *.md             # Individual how-to guides
   ├── templates/
   └── standards/
   ```

3. **Manifest Updates**:
   - Update plugin manifest schema to include `howtos` section
   - Validation for how-to file structure
   - Discovery mechanism for available how-tos

4. **Integration with agents.md**:
   - How-tos should be listed in `.ai/index.yaml`
   - agents.md should reference available how-tos by category
   - Cross-references between how-tos and templates

**How-To Structure** (standardized format):
```markdown

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

1. **Dogfooding**: Use our own patterns immediately (✅ done with PR0)
2. **Standalone-First**: Each component must work independently
3. **Test-Driven**: Three test repos validate all usage patterns
4. **Incremental**: Each PR maintains a working state
5. **Composable**: Components combine without conflicts
6. **Documented**: Every component has clear AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Agent can setup new repo from empty directory in <30min
- [ ] Agent can resume from PROGRESS_TRACKER.md after interruption
- [ ] Components install independently without orchestrator
- [ ] All three test repos validate successfully
- [ ] Zero breaking changes between components

### Feature Metrics
- [ ] Framework supports Python projects (Ruff/Black/pytest)
- [ ] Framework supports TypeScript projects (ESLint/Prettier/Vitest)
- [ ] Framework supports full-stack projects (Python + TypeScript + React)
- [ ] Framework includes Docker containerization (frontend + backend)
- [ ] Framework includes CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Framework includes Terraform AWS infrastructure (VPC/ECS/ALB workspaces)
- [ ] Framework includes Pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Framework includes Security standards
- [ ] Framework includes Documentation standards
- [ ] All patterns extracted from durable-code-test-2

## 🔄 Update Protocol

After completing each PR:
1. Update the PR status to 🟢 Complete
2. Fill in completion percentage
3. Add any important notes or blockers
4. Update the "Next PR to Implement" section
5. Update overall progress percentage
6. Update phase completion percentages
7. Update `agents.md` if project capabilities changed
8. Commit changes to the progress document

## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context
- **Plugin-Based Architecture**: Everything is a plugin (foundation, languages, infrastructure, standards)
- **Modularity is Key**: Every plugin must be standalone and independently installable
- **State Tracking**: PROGRESS_TRACKER.md enables resume from any point
- **Three Test Repos**: Empty, incremental, existing - validate all patterns
- **Templates Source**: Extract from durable-code-test-2 (templates, configs, patterns)
- **Plugin Structure**: Each has AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md + templates/ + configs/
- **Extensibility**: _template/ directories show how to add new plugins

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't create monolithic components - keep them focused
- Don't skip dependency declarations - be explicit
- Don't assume orchestrator is always used - standalone is critical
- Don't forget to test in all three test repos
- Don't merge to main without updating this PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
- Don't add temporal/progress info to `agents.md` - it describes the project as-is, not development status
- **Don't assume local tool execution** - Always prioritize Docker, then isolated environments, then local as last resort
- **Don't pollute global environment** - All tools should run in containers or project-isolated environments
