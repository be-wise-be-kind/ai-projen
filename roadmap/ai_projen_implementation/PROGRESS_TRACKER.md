# AI-Projen Implementation - Progress Tracker & AI Agent Handoff Document

**Purpose**: Primary AI agent handoff document for AI-Projen Implementation with current progress tracking and implementation guidance

**Scope**: Complete implementation of the ai-projen framework - a modular, composable system for creating AI-ready repositories

**Overview**: Primary handoff document for AI agents working on the AI-Projen Implementation feature.
    Tracks current implementation progress, provides next action guidance, and coordinates AI agent work across
    multiple pull requests. Contains current status, prerequisite validation, PR dashboard, detailed checklists,
    implementation strategy, success metrics, and AI agent instructions. Essential for maintaining development
    continuity and ensuring systematic feature implementation with proper validation and testing.

**Dependencies**: [durable-code-test](https://github.com/steve-e-jackson/durable-code-test) repository (source of patterns and templates), three test repositories (test-empty-setup, test-incremental-setup, test-upgrade-existing)

**Exports**: Progress tracking, implementation guidance, AI agent coordination, and feature development roadmap

**Related**: AI_CONTEXT.md for feature overview, PR_BREAKDOWN.md for detailed tasks

**Implementation**: Progress-driven coordination with systematic validation, checklist management, and AI agent handoff procedures

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

1. **Dogfooding**: Use our own patterns immediately (✅ done with PR0)
2. **Standalone-First**: Each component must work independently
3. **Test-Driven**: Three test repos validate all usage patterns
4. **Incremental**: Each PR maintains a working state
5. **Composable**: Components combine without conflicts
6. **Documented**: Every component has clear AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Agent can setup new repo from empty directory in <30min
- [ ] Agent can resume from PROGRESS_TRACKER.md after interruption
- [ ] Components install independently without orchestrator
- [ ] All three test repos validate successfully
- [ ] Zero breaking changes between components

### Feature Metrics
- [ ] Framework supports Python projects (Ruff/Black/pytest)
- [ ] Framework supports TypeScript projects (ESLint/Prettier/Vitest)
- [ ] Framework supports full-stack projects (Python + TypeScript + React)
- [ ] Framework includes Docker containerization (frontend + backend)
- [ ] Framework includes CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Framework includes Terraform AWS infrastructure (VPC/ECS/ALB workspaces)
- [ ] Framework includes Pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Framework includes Security standards
- [ ] Framework includes Documentation standards
- [ ] All patterns extracted from durable-code-test-2

## 🔄 Update Protocol

After completing each PR:
1. Update the PR status to 🟢 Complete
2. Fill in completion percentage
3. Add any important notes or blockers
4. Update the "Next PR to Implement" section
5. Update overall progress percentage
6. Update phase completion percentages
7. Commit changes to the progress document

## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context
- **Plugin-Based Architecture**: Everything is a plugin (foundation, languages, infrastructure, standards)
- **Modularity is Key**: Every plugin must be standalone and independently installable
- **State Tracking**: PROGRESS_TRACKER.md enables resume from any point
- **Three Test Repos**: Empty, incremental, existing - validate all patterns
- **Templates Source**: Extract from durable-code-test-2 (templates, configs, patterns)
- **Plugin Structure**: Each has AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md + templates/ + configs/
- **Extensibility**: _template/ directories show how to add new plugins

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't create monolithic components - keep them focused
- Don't skip dependency declarations - be explicit
- Don't assume orchestrator is always used - standalone is critical
- Don't forget to test in all three test repos
- Don't merge to main without updating this PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
