# AI-Projen Implementation - Progress Tracker & AI Agent Handoff Document

**Purpose**: Primary AI agent handoff document for AI-Projen Implementation with current progress tracking and implementation guidance

**Scope**: Complete implementation of the ai-projen framework - a modular, composable system for creating AI-ready repositories

**Overview**: Primary handoff document for AI agents working on the AI-Projen Implementation feature.
    Tracks current implementation progress, provides next action guidance, and coordinates AI agent work across
    multiple pull requests. Contains current status, prerequisite validation, PR dashboard, detailed checklists,
    implementation strategy, success metrics, and AI agent instructions. Essential for maintaining development
    continuity and ensuring systematic feature implementation with proper validation and testing.

**Dependencies**: [durable-code-test](https://github.com/steve-e-jackson/durable-code-test) repository (source of patterns and templates), three test repositories (test-empty-setup, test-incremental-setup, test-upgrade-existing)

**Exports**: Progress tracking, implementation guidance, AI agent coordination, and feature development roadmap

**Related**: AI_CONTEXT.md for feature overview, PR_BREAKDOWN.md for detailed tasks

**Implementation**: Progress-driven coordination with systematic validation, checklist management, and AI agent handoff procedures

## 🤖 Document Purpose
This is the **PRIMARY HANDOFF DOCUMENT** for AI agents working on the AI-Projen Implementation feature. When starting work on any PR, the AI agent should:
1. **Read this document FIRST** to understand current progress and feature requirements
2. **Check the "Next PR to Implement" section** for what to do
3. **Reference the linked documents** for detailed instructions
4. **Update this document** after completing each PR

## 📍 Current Status
**Current PR**: PR7.5 In Progress - Docker-first development pattern refactor
**Infrastructure State**: PR5, PR6, PR7 completed by agents but need Docker-first updates before commit
**Feature Target**: Modular AI-ready repository template framework with Docker-first development
**Critical Decision**: All development should prioritize Docker > Isolated Env > Local Direct

## 🎯 Next PR to Implement

### ➡️ START HERE: PR7.5 - Docker-First Development Pattern

**Quick Summary**:
Update Python plugin, TypeScript plugin, and documentation to enforce Docker-first development pattern. Docker is preferred, isolated environments (Poetry/venv) are fallback, direct local execution is last resort.

**Pre-flight Checklist**:
- ✅ PR5, PR6, PR7 completed by agents (not yet committed)
- ✅ Access to durable-code-test for Docker patterns
- ⬜ Understanding of development environment hierarchy

**Critical Issue Identified**:
Current plugins assume direct local tool execution. Need to update to:
1. **Docker** (preferred) - Consistent environments, no local pollution
2. **Isolated environments** (fallback) - Poetry/venv for Python, npm for TypeScript
3. **Direct local** (last resort) - Only if Docker unavailable

**Files to Update**:

Python Plugin:
- AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Add Docker preference step
- templates/makefile-python.mk - Docker-first targets with auto-detection
- templates/Dockerfile.python - NEW
- templates/docker-compose.python.yml - NEW
- standards/python-standards.md - Emphasize Docker
- README.md - Docker-first quick start

TypeScript Plugin:
- AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md - Add Docker preference step
- templates/makefile-typescript.mk - Docker-first targets
- templates/Dockerfile.typescript - NEW
- templates/docker-compose.typescript.yml - NEW
- standards/typescript-standards.md - Docker approach
- README.md - Docker-first quick start

Documentation:
- .ai/docs/DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md - NEW: Explain hierarchy
- .ai/howto/how-to-create-a-language-plugin.md - Add Docker-first section

**Prerequisites Complete**: Yes - PR5, PR6, PR7 completed, awaiting Docker-first refactor

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

1. **Dogfooding**: Use our own patterns immediately (✅ done with PR0)
2. **Standalone-First**: Each component must work independently
3. **Test-Driven**: Three test repos validate all usage patterns
4. **Incremental**: Each PR maintains a working state
5. **Composable**: Components combine without conflicts
6. **Documented**: Every component has clear AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Agent can setup new repo from empty directory in <30min
- [ ] Agent can resume from PROGRESS_TRACKER.md after interruption
- [ ] Components install independently without orchestrator
- [ ] All three test repos validate successfully
- [ ] Zero breaking changes between components

### Feature Metrics
- [ ] Framework supports Python projects (Ruff/Black/pytest)
- [ ] Framework supports TypeScript projects (ESLint/Prettier/Vitest)
- [ ] Framework supports full-stack projects (Python + TypeScript + React)
- [ ] Framework includes Docker containerization (frontend + backend)
- [ ] Framework includes CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Framework includes Terraform AWS infrastructure (VPC/ECS/ALB workspaces)
- [ ] Framework includes Pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Framework includes Security standards
- [ ] Framework includes Documentation standards
- [ ] All patterns extracted from durable-code-test-2

## 🔄 Update Protocol

After completing each PR:
1. Update the PR status to 🟢 Complete
2. Fill in completion percentage
3. Add any important notes or blockers
4. Update the "Next PR to Implement" section
5. Update overall progress percentage
6. Update phase completion percentages
7. Update `agents.md` if project capabilities changed
8. Commit changes to the progress document

## 📝 Notes for AI Agents

### Critical Context
- **Plugin-Based Architecture**: Everything is a plugin (foundation, languages, infrastructure, standards)
- **Modularity is Key**: Every plugin must be standalone and independently installable
- **State Tracking**: PROGRESS_TRACKER.md enables resume from any point
- **Three Test Repos**: Empty, incremental, existing - validate all patterns
- **Templates Source**: Extract from durable-code-test-2 (templates, configs, patterns)
- **Plugin Structure**: Each has AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md + templates/ + configs/
- **Extensibility**: _template/ directories show how to add new plugins

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't create monolithic components - keep them focused
- Don't skip dependency declarations - be explicit
- Don't assume orchestrator is always used - standalone is critical
- Don't forget to test in all three test repos
- Don't merge to main without updating this PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
- Don't add temporal/progress info to `agents.md` - it describes the project as-is, not development status
- **Don't assume local tool execution** - Always prioritize Docker, then isolated environments, then local as last resort
- **Don't pollute global environment** - All tools should run in containers or project-isolated environments
